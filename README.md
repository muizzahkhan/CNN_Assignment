# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains code for Image Classification using CNN.
Major libraries used in this project are: 
 
 a. Keras
 
 b. Numpy
  
 c. Matplotlib
 
Keras is an open-source python library built on tensorflow, which provides easy to use APIs for creating and learning deep learning models.
Numpy is used for image pre-processing.
Matplotlib is used to visualize the input and outputs.

The image dataset of natural scenes around the world consist of 25k images of (150, 150, 3). Data has 6 classes namely buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street. A glimpse of data is given below:

After data augmentation and training our model, the accuracy and loss is as follows:
